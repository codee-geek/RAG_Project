bugs: 


This is fragile because:
unstructured classification varies wildly across:
PDFs
scanned PDFs
DOCX
TXt
Stories often:
have no headings
or only one title
or headings are misclassified
Result:
Entire documents may collapse into:
PREFACE or one massive section That’s bad for retrieval.

3️⃣ Minimum section size gate (this is a real problem)
if buffer and len(" ".join(buffer)) > 200:
This silently discards content.
For:
short stories
FAQs
notes
slides
structured bullets
