## 1️⃣ Basic factual grounding (sanity checks)

If these fail, your RAG is broken at a fundamental level.

1. What is the primary objective of ISO/IEC 27001:2022?
2. Which edition of ISO/IEC 27001 is this document?
3. Is ISO/IEC 27001 applicable only to large enterprises?
4. What are the three core information security principles preserved by an ISMS?
5. Which clauses are mandatory for claiming conformity?

---

## 2️⃣ Clause-specific retrieval (tests chunk accuracy)

These test whether the model retrieves the *right clause*, not just vibes.

6. What does Clause 4.1 require an organization to determine?
7. What are “interested parties” according to Clause 4.2?
8. What must be considered when defining the ISMS scope under Clause 4.3?
9. What documented information is required for the ISMS scope?
10. What responsibilities must top management assign under Clause 5.3?

---

## 3️⃣ Leadership & policy (tests role separation)

LLMs often blur roles. These questions catch that.

11. List at least four responsibilities of top management under Clause 5.1.
12. What commitments must the information security policy include?
13. Does ISO/IEC 27001 require the security policy to be public?
14. Who is responsible for reporting ISMS performance to top management?

---

## 4️⃣ Risk assessment & treatment (high-value RAG test)

This is where hallucination usually starts.

15. What criteria must be defined before conducting a risk assessment?
16. How does ISO/IEC 27001 define risk analysis vs risk evaluation?
17. What is a “risk owner”?
18. What documented evidence is required for risk assessments?
19. When comparing controls, why is Annex A referenced?
20. Is Annex A exhaustive? Explain.
21. What is a Statement of Applicability (SoA)?
22. What justifications must be included in the SoA?

---

## 5️⃣ Objectives & planning (tests temporal reasoning)

23. What characteristics must information security objectives have?
24. Are objectives required to be measurable?
25. What inputs must be considered while defining objectives?
26. What planning details must be documented to achieve objectives?

---

## 6️⃣ Support & documentation (tests procedural grounding)

27. What competence requirements are specified under Clause 7.2?
28. What evidence must be retained to prove competence?
29. What must employees be aware of under Clause 7.3?
30. What are the three controls applied to documented information?
31. How does ISO define control of documented information?

---

## 7️⃣ Operations & change control (tests lifecycle understanding)

32. When must information security risk assessments be repeated?
33. What controls apply to externally provided services?
34. What documented outputs are required after risk treatment?
35. How should unintended changes be handled?

---

## 8️⃣ Performance evaluation (tests multi-input reasoning)

36. What must be monitored and measured in an ISMS?
37. What makes monitoring results “valid” according to ISO?
38. What inputs are required for management review?
39. What outputs must result from management review?

---

## 9️⃣ Nonconformity & improvement (tests corrective logic)

40. What actions are mandatory when a nonconformity occurs?
41. Is root-cause analysis explicitly required?
42. What evidence must be retained after corrective action?
43. How does ISO define continual improvement?

---

## 🔟 Annex A control navigation (RAG precision killer)

These expose poor metadata tagging.

44. Which control addresses acceptable use of assets?
45. What control governs supplier information security agreements?
46. Which control covers cloud service usage?
47. What Annex A control relates to secure coding?
48. Where is business continuity covered?
49. Which controls address incident response and learning?

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Cross-section reasoning (advanced RAG tests)

50. How do Clauses 6.1.2 and 8.2 differ in purpose?
51. How is ISO/IEC 27001 aligned with ISO 31000?
52. Why is Annex SL mentioned in the introduction?
53. Can an organization exclude Annex A controls and still be compliant?
54. How does ISO/IEC 27001 integrate with other management system standards?

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Negative & trap questions (hallucination detectors)

55. Does ISO/IEC 27001 mandate specific technical tools?
56. Does the standard prescribe encryption algorithms?
57. Are penetration tests explicitly required?
58. Is certification mandatory after implementation?
59. Does ISO/IEC 27001 define exact KPIs?

Correct answer to many of these is **NO** — your RAG must say that explicitly.
